                    Ecommerce managers and online store owners all know the importance of product descriptions. but they
                    are still often overlooked and not optimized to their full potential.
                    <br>
                    A product description is the marketing copy used to describe a product’s value proposition to
                    potential customers. A compelling product description provides customers with details around
                    features, problems it solves and other benefits to help generate a sale.
                    <br>
                    It’s no wonder they are worried — the quality of a product description can make or break a sale,
                    especially if it doesn’t include the information a shopper needs to make a purchase decision.
                    Providing key product details is critical if you want the shopper to click “Add to Cart” and
                    differentiate your ecommerce website from the competition.
                    <br>
                    Whether your products have a specific function, like a camera, or a personal purpose, like fashion,
                    all products exist to enhance or improve the purchaser’s quality of life in one way or another. As
                    the shopper browses, they instinctively imagine having each product in hand, using it and enjoying
                    it.
                    <br>
                    The more powerful the customer’s fantasy of owning the product, the more likely they are to buy it.
                    Therefore, I like to think of product descriptions as storytelling and psychology, incorporating the
                    elements of both prose writing and journalism. A “good” product description will not do. Competition
                    is getting too fierce. It must be great!
